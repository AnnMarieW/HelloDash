### The Dash Bootstrap Theme Explorer will help you improve the design of your Dash app. 

 - The Theme Explorer app makes it easy to see how different Bootstrap themes, Plotly figure templates and colors 
will look in your app.
   
 - The Component Gallery shows a sample of the components available and how they respond to different Bootstrap and
Bootswatch themes.  For the DataTable and some Dash Core Components, there are examples of how to 
   use the `style` and `className` properties and custom CSS to make them look great with your selected Bootstrap theme. 
   
- The App Gallery has examples of Dash Apps made with Bootstrap.  
  
- The Cheatsheet is a page with my favorite links to help with app design.

This is still a work in progress --  I would love to hear comments and suggestions for improvements. If you have design tips
or would like to add an app to the gallery, feel free to open an issue.  See details below.


## The Theme Explorer 

Choose from:
 - 22 [Boostrap Bootswatch themes](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/bootswatch/)
 - 11 [Plotly Graph Templates](https://plotly.com/python/templates/)

 - 94 [Plotly Graph Continuous Colorscales](https://plotly.com/python/builtin-colorscales/)

### These two images are the same app!  Only 1 line of code is changed to set a different theme.

When you decide on a design you like, you can take note of the settings and add them into your own app, or use one of the
sample apps to get started. See the App Gallery for more examples.  If you have an app that you would like to include
in the gallery, please open an [issue](https://github.com/AnnMarieW/HelloDash/issues) and include the following information:

1) An image of your app
2) A short title to appear on the card in the gallery
3) A link to the Github/GitLab ect for your code
4) An extended description of your app.  This will be displayed in a dcc.Markdown component, so feel free to include any
compatible Markdown formatting and links etc.
