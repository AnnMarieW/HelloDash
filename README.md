When you decide on a scheme you like, you can take note of the settings and add them into your own app, or use one of the
sample apps to get started. 

See the App Gallery for more examples.  If you have an app that you would like to include in the gallery, please open
an [issue](https://github.com/AnnMarieW/HelloDash/issues) and include the following information:

1) An image of your app
2) A short title to appear on the card in the gallery
3) A link to the Github/GitLab ect for your code
4) An extended description of your app.  This will be displayed in a dcc.Markdown component, so feel free to include any
compatible Markdown formatting and links etc.
   

The Component Gallery shows how all the components look with different themes.  It also shows how to use the `style` 
and `className` properties and custom CSS to fine tune your design.  

This app is still a work in progress.  If you have any design tips you would like to share, please open an issue,
and I'll add it to the app!
